# RosharanFood
Analyzing the food and drink mentioned in the Stormlight Archive and related WoB. Focus for my restless energy as much as anything else, but someday would be lovely to host a cosmere night with matching food!

# Project Organization (plan):
Folder of all references within the books to food
- Will need a list of keywords to search
- Borrowing my friend's kindle to be able to search the book's text easily
- Full-text references are discouraged on the coppermind, so this would be an appropriate use of GitHub instead of just putting it there
- Also, references to webpages who have attempted this task in the past

Document synthesizing references - Put in this repository's wiki? Put in the coppermind?
- List categories and characteristics of foods
- Example:
- Curries
  - General information: Curries are ___ and ___, and are considered staple food by ____. Usually  made with soulcast meat for soldiers, but can also be made with...
  - Alethi Curries
    - Sweet
    - Spicy
    - See also: Azish curries, Herdazian Curries
- Wines
  - "Wines" are actually just a term for all alcoholic drinks on Roshar: most wines don't really match what we think of as wines. The exception is shin wines, which do correlate with our wines here on earth. Brandon claims that beer doesn't really exist, but they do talk about lavis beer...
    - Alethi wines
      - Orange
      - Reds
      - Blues... (I don't remember the names now)  

Do we make a second document or multiple documents connecting the characteristics of the food from in-world perspective to real-life foods? Or do we put that as lines on the main syntheszing document?

Folder of recipies
- More "recipie concepts" than actual recipies (unless I have WAY more free time than I thought)
-
