This page is not to describe the various foods, ingredients, tastes. It's just to list any search terms that might be helpful. So stuff mentioned in a WoB doesn't belong here unless it also appears in the books (see https://wob.coppermind.net/events/409-youtube-livestream-1/#e13805, he mentions sweet potato, but I doubt that's actually in the books. I'm including it for now, but will remove if it has no search results). Also include the plurals if different (curry vs curries).
