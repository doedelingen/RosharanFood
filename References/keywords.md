This page is not to describe the various foods, ingredients, tastes. It's just to list any search terms that might be helpful. So stuff mentioned in a WoB doesn't belong here unless it also appears in the books (see https://wob.coppermind.net/events/409-youtube-livestream-1/#e13805, he mentions sweet potato, but I doubt that's actually in the books. I'm including it for now, but will remove if it has no search results). Also include the plurals if different (curry vs curries).

Parse this passage:
 Here is the food from the Oathbringer flashback (chapter 19):

"servants brought out slabs of pork and lanka claws for the men, cooked in a savory broth"
"Dalinar finished the claws, then turned toward his pork, a succulent slab of meat swimming in gravy."
"The meat was growing cold, but still smelled delicious."
"the serving staff entered with teas and fruit to close the meal; one tried to take his steak,"
